Branch for Forth-CPU project only!

See <https://github.com/howerj/forth-cpu>.

This version is designed to be more like the H2 CPU.

## To Do / Wish list

* [ ] Change the virtual machine to be more like the H2.
* [ ] Make a variant that is a compatible superset of the H2 that has special
instructions for hosted I/O. This version could be used to make a self hosting
version of the 'H2'. It would also need more memory than the H2.
* [ ] Copy over the original documentation from the 'embed.fth' project.
* [ ] It might be nice to make a version of the H2 for hosted use for making tiny
games by adding graphics and sound to the virtual machine, on another branch.
